## Welcome to Expect scripting Tutorial

The tutorial can be used as a reference while creating expect scripts



## Some of the basic commands used in Expect are 
*spawn*     Starting a script or a program.

*expect*    Waiting for program output.

*send*       Sending a reply to your program.

*interact*   Allowing you in interact with your program.

## Example 1:
**How to create a sample expect script**

```
#!/usr/bin/expect -f

set timeout -1
spawn root@remoteserver
expect "Password:"
send "****\r"
expect "#"
interact
```


#!/usr/bin/expect -f
> Guiding the interpreter to run it as expect program.

set timeout -1
> Setting the timeout to infinity 

spawn ssh root@remoteserver
> Run a program to perform a ssh to the remote server

expect "Password:"
> Expect a "Passoword:" prompt

send "****\r"
> Send the password, \r is carriage return (enter)

interact
> Terminal will be remained open for you to perform operations on remote server


#Working with variables:

Use **set** commnad to define a variable and **$** to access the variable 

## Examples for variables

**set var1 10**
> Declaring a variable var1 and assigning a value of 10

**set var1 [lindex $argv 0]**
**set var2 [lindex $argv 1]**
> Assign command line arguments as variables in script
